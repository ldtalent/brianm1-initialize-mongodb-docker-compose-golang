Setting up a Golang application server is not that hard but what happens when you are working with a NoSQL database like MongoDB which requires a user setup to handle basic CRUD. It gets complicated and even more complicated when using platforms like Docker. But it does not end there, if working with other services at the same time, such as Redis and RabbitMQ which require some form of wait period to set up. You'll easily find yourself in a bad place. 
This project is simply for that purpose to help anyone who would like to know how to set up a Mongo User for this very purpose. It also includes a paradigm that can be applied to other services/libraries that require an initial set up.
